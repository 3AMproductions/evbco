  <h2>Account Executives</h2>
  <p>Account Executive positions are currently available at the E.V. Bishoff Company.</p>
  <p>As an Account Executive of the E.V. Bishoff Company, you no longer need to be concerned about obtaining listings. The E.V. Bishoff Company owns and manages its own properties and therefore obtaining listings is not necessary.</p>
  <p>The E.V. Bishoff Company has taken a very unique approach to its Account Executives. Unlike your typical Leasing Agent, our Account Executives retain a Book of Business which consists of clients in our portfolio. The Account Executive is paid a monthly residual on every rent dollar received via their Book of Business in addition to commissions and bonus'. As your Book of Business grows, so does your monthly take home pay. Account Executives are assigned a territory and are given constant training in the areas of marketing, self-development and their Book of Business.</p>
  <p>Compensation to our Account Executives is in three general areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They receive a residual on every rent dollar paid by their clients in their Book of Business.</li>
    <li>They receive a commission on every new and renewed lease.</li>
    <li>A bonus structure when specified targets are met.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your working day will consist largely of managing your Book of Business to ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction possible and to expand and renew existing clients, working a pre-described territory and meeting quotas to create new business.</p>
  <p>This is a fast-paced organization where only the most qualified need to apply. You need to be organized, smart and love to make a deal. To be considered for an Account Executive position with the E.V. Bishoff Company, forward your resume to the Corporate Office at 33 N. Third Street, Suite 500, Columbus, OH 43215.</p>
  <p>The E.V. Bishoff Company will strive to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Satisfy and retain our clients 100% of the time</li>
